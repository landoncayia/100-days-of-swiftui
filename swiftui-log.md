# #100DaysOfSwiftUI Log - Landon Cayia

The log of my #100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge. Started on Tuesday, June 7, 2022. I did not think to maintain a log during the first 43 days of this experience, but I decided to begin one on day 44!

*Note: I paused this challenge for a while starting July 9, due to some personal circumstances, but I have resumed as of July 25!*
