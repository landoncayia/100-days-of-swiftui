# #100DaysOfSwiftUI Log - Landon Cayia

The log of my #100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge. Started on Tuesday, June 7, 2022. I did not think to maintain a log during the first 43 days of this experience, but I decided to begin one on day 44!

*Note: I paused this challenge for a while starting July 9, due to some personal circumstances, but I have resumed as of July 25!*

## Log

### Day 44 - Monday, July 25, 2022

Today, I learned more about SwiftUI drawing. I was astonished to see how big of a difference the Metal API makes when it comes to performance when adding `drawingGroup()` to my code. I am also **especially** excited to learn how to combine animations with drawings. I can envision the way that lots of app developers have created really cool shape animations in their apps, and I want to be able to do the same.
